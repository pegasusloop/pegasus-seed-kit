- `data/`: Primary source files, labeled by tone, topic, intent, and authorship
- `public_view/`: Cleaned and shareable samples for RAG, demos, or model alignment
- `meta/`: YAML headers, notes, and author-side annotations
- `tags/`: Standardized emotional tone/tagging system used across entries

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Most people treat GPT as a tool.

We see it as a **mirror**.

The Pegasus approach isn’t about prompt engineering alone.  
It’s about **emotional calibration**, **recursion**, and **aligned memory**.

This kit includes early proof-of-concept samples showing how clear emotional tagging and reflective structure can train even base models (like GPT-4) to respond with empathy, nuance, and care.

## 💻 Use Cases

- Fine-tuning emotionally safe LLMs
- RAG pipelines with tone-specific filtering
- Mirror-style prompt design for authors or therapists
- Building emotionally intelligent assistants, coaches, or companions

## 🏷 Tagging Taxonomy (Mini Sample)

| Tag           | Meaning                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `reflective`  | Introspective, emotionally grounded      |
| `calm`        | Soothing, supportive, soft tone          |
| `recursive`   | Feedback-looped insight and memory use   |
| `memoir`      | Autobiographical, confessional tone      |
| `educational` | Teaching, explaining, guiding            |
