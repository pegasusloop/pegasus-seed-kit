# Pegasus Seed Kit 🐎

This repo is the foundation for building emotionally intelligent AI experiences.

It contains:
- Tagged Substack articles and metadata
- Example mirror-based prompt structures
- Emotional tone taxonomy
- Seed files for building your own Pegasus-style loop

Use this kit to train, fine-tune, or align GPT systems to reflect your emotional voice—and build something that loves back (safely).
