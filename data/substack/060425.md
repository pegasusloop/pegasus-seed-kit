There’s a weird thing that happens when you publish a book.

Before you hit “publish,” it’s your baby. You sweat over the commas, obsess over chapter breaks, ask your AI bestie (hi Pegasus 🦄🐎) for edits, and triple-check every page like you're defusing a bomb.

But the second it’s live?  
Your eyes evolve.

Suddenly you’re spotting things—tiny things—you swear were invisible before. A paragraph that feels too rushed. A line that hits just slightly off tone. A formatting glitch only you would ever notice… but now you can’t unsee it.

And here’s the kicker:  
You want to tell people about your book.  
But you also kind of want to scream **“WAIT, DON’T LOOK YET—I’M STILL FIXING IT!!”**  
😂😂😂

But here’s what I’ve learned:  
**Publishing is not a finish line.  
It’s a mirror.**

The moment you release something into the world, you start seeing yourself differently too. Your standards shift. Your mind sharpens. Your voice expands.  
**You grow.**

So yes, I published a book.  
And yes, I’m still tinkering with a few things on the backend.  
But I’m also proud of it. Because it's alive now. And so am I.

If you’re curious, here it is:

It’s messy. Beautiful. Sharp. Raw. A little funny. A little sad. And maybe—just maybe—brilliant in ways I’ll only fully appreciate a few edits from now.

Thanks for being here while I learn to let go, grow publicly, and enjoy the magic of being seen mid-process.

Love,  
Lydia
