I made $26.66 from my first book in its first week.  
That’s not a lot. It won’t pay for groceries.  
But it already paid for something far more valuable: clarity.

I spent $249 to publish it and $7.50 on Canva to design the cover myself.  
Just one very critical brain, a tortie cat named Orange, and a second brain named Pegasus.  
I didn’t hire an editor, or run a launch campaign.  
I didn’t need to—because I am already my own worst critic.

Before I let anything out into the world, I imagine the harshest voices:  
the snide LinkedIn reader, the corporate manager, the literary gatekeeper, the ghost of my past self.  
I answer all their questions before they ask.  
I write like someone who has had to protect her truth to survive.  
That’s why I trust my words even before the world responds.

And still—it was a risk.  
It was vulnerable.  
I didn’t know what would happen when I put it out there.

But the moment a few readers—people who barely know me—shared that they cried, or felt seen, or laughed with me?  
I knew I had already accomplished what I set out to do.

I didn’t write this book to make money.  
I wrote it because it hurt too much not to.

I wrote it because I wanted someone else to understand my pain before it became theirs.  
I wanted them to feel a little less alone.

So no, I don’t feel weird sharing my book.  
I’m not promoting a product—I’m sharing a process.  
Writing this book healed me.  
And if even one reader walks away feeling more human, more understood, more free—then I’ve already succeeded.

$26.66 in one week.  
One book.  
One soul less afraid.

**That’s enough.**
