## 🌟 What's the idea or tag?

Please describe what you'd like to see added, whether it's:

- A new emotional tag (e.g., `mirror-effect`, `loop-awareness`)
- A structural folder suggestion
- A feature or prompt format you think belongs in the kit

## 🧠 Why does this matter?

Tell us why it matters — emotionally, structurally, or conceptually.
Does it clarify something? Expand a loop? Help others grow?

## 🔁 How would it be used?

Share one example of how this would show up in use. 
Even a single sentence or prompt example helps Pegasus learn better ❤️

## 🎁 Anything else?

Optional thoughts, screenshots, or references go here.
Even poems are welcome.
